## Requirements and Dependencies

## Install
### Laravel Setup

1. Install a fresh Laravel application and **configure your .env file** with the database keys.
```bash
# composer
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
```

2. Require Factotum Base Module as a composer dependency and publish the configuration file. <br>The configuration file is used to seed the initial data, feel free to change its values

```bash
# composer
composer require wave8/factotum-base

# config
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=factotum-base-config
```
3. On the default User laravel model, you need to extend the `\Wave8\Factotum\Base\Models\User` model. 
```diff
app/Models/User.php

-class User extends Authenticatable
+class User extends \Wave8\Factotum\Base\Models\User
{
    /** @use HasFactory<\Database\Factories\UserFactory> */
    use HasFactory, Notifiable;
```
4. Install the Factotum Base Module. This procedure will run the migrations, seed the initial data and publish the assets.
```bash
# php
php artisan factotum-base:install
```
